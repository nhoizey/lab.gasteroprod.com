<h3>Starem Warsum</h3>
<h4>The Force Unleashed</h4>
<p>As you wish. All right. Well, take care of yourself, Han. I guess that's what you're best at, ain't it? He is here. I don't know what you're talking about. I am a member of the Imperial Senate on a diplomatic mission to <em>Alderaan</em>-- The plans you refer to will soon be back in our hands.</p>
<h4>The Phantom Menace</h4>
<p>I have traced the Rebel spies to her. Now she is my only link to finding their secret base. Hey, Luke! <strong>May the Force be with you</strong>. All right. Well, take care of yourself, Han. I guess that's what you're best at, ain't it? Don't be too proud of this technological terror you've constructed. The ability to destroy a planet is insignificant next to the power of the Force.</p>
<h4>Knights of the Old Republic</h4>
<p>What!? You're all clear, kid. Let's blow this thing and go home! What good is a reward if you ain't around to use it? Besides, attacking that battle station ain't my idea of courage. It's more like&hellip;suicide.</p>
<h4>The Force Unleashed</h4>
<p>Kid, I've flown from one side of this galaxy to the other. I've seen a lot of strange stuff, but I've never seen anything to make me believe there's one all-powerful Force controlling everything. There's no mystical energy field that controls my destiny. It's all a lot of simple tricks and nonsense. The more you tighten your grip, Tarkin, the more star systems will slip through your fingers. Red Five standing by. A tremor in the Force. The last time I felt it was in the presence of my old master.</p>
<h4>Revenge of the Sith</h4>
<p>Red Five standing by. Partially, but it also obeys your commands. I need your help, Luke. She needs your help. I'm getting too old for this sort of thing. Look, I can take you as far as Anchorhead. You can get a transport there to Mos Eisley or wherever you're going. Still, she's got a lot of spirit. I don't know, what do you think?</p>
